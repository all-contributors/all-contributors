Contributors should be recognised as soon as the contribution is discovered to help ensure their efforts are not
overlooked when the list gets updated at a later date. This can be difficult for contributions that are not the result of a commit to the repository but do your best to minimise the time between the contribution and updating the list.

> **Pro tip:** If your project is configured for [the @all-contributors bot ðŸ¤–](bot/overview) simply write a comment on an issue or pull request to recognise their contribution. For example:
>
> `@all-contributors please add @tbenning for design` âœ¨

As the captain of the ship or the ringleader of the repository, it's important to remember that keeping the list of contributors shipshape and Bristol fashion shouldn't fall solely on your shoulders. Instead, it's crucial to actively rally and empower others to keep the list current and polished.

This can be achieved through a variety of means such as dropping a comment on the issue thread, adding a section in a blog post or response, or through more direct forms of communication such as sending an email or DM. By fostering a collaborative and inclusive atmosphere, the repository will be able to reap the rewards of contributions from a diverse and talented crew.

It's important to note that some contributors may not realize that their efforts warrant recognition on the contributors list. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the criteria for inclusion or a belief that their contributions aren't significant enough. As the captain of the ship or the ringleader of the repository, it's important to actively encourage these individuals to add themselves to the list.

But, in cases where the contributor may be hesitant, it may be necessary for you to take the helm and add them to the list yourself. However, it's important to ensure that they are comfortable with this decision and that it's done through a transparent process, such as a pull request. The goal is to maintain an inclusive and collaborative environment where all contributions are valued and recognized.

In the end, there are no hard and fast rules for when a contribution has to be added to the list,
just do your best to be fair and to ensure all contributors are recognised.

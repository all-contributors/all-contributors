## Commands
<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

### `@all-contributors add`
 Comment on Issue or Pull Request, asking @all-contributors to add a contributor:

```
@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>
```

**\<contribution>**: See the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](../emoji-key) for a list of valid `contribution` types.

The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor, then reply with the pull request details.

> Your request to the bot doesn't need to be perfect. The bot will use [basic Natural Language Parsing](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot/blob/master/src/tasks/processIssueComment/utils/parse-comment/index.js) to determine your intent.
> For example, this will work too:
>
> `Jane you are crushing it in documentation and your infrastructure work has been great too. Let's add @jane.doe23 for her contributions. cc @all-contributors`

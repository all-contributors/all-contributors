### All Contributors badge count, does not update?

To have the Badge update correctly, you must wrap your badge in start and end tags (as also done from the contribution table)

#### Previously

```markdown
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-13-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)
```

#### Now

```markdown
<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-13-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)
<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-BADGE:END --> 
```

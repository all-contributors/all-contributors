## 1. Install from NPM
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-contributors-cli">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/all-contributors-cli.svg" alt="NPM Version" />
</a>

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org/) and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```console
yarn add --dev all-contributors-cli # or npm
```

> The CLI is node based, if you don't wish to add a node depdendency use the [@all-contributors bot ðŸ¤–](../bot/overview)


## 2. Init the Project
Init the project using `init` and answer a few questions

```console
yarn all-contributors init # npm run

# Or directly execute the bin
./node_modules/.bin/all-contributors init
```

## 3. Add some contributors
```console
yarn all-contributors add jfmengels doc
yarn all-contributors generate
```
For more on the commands see [CLI usage](usage)


## 4. Update your Contributing documentation
Consider updating your `CONTRIBUTING.md` or similar with steps on how your contributors can add themselves. You can even link to the [cli usage documentation](usage).


## 5. *Optionally* add shortcut scripts to your `package.json`
You can optionally add shortcuts to your commands in your `package.json` `scripts` field.

For example:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "contributors:add": "all-contributors add",
    "contributors:generate": "all-contributors generate"
  }
}
```

To allow shortcuts such as
```console
yarn contributors:add jfmengels doc
```

> Call for translators! [We're looking for translators](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/issues/143) to help translate this spec for everyone!

## Help improve the all-contributors documentation!

Thanks for your interest in the project!
Pull Requests welcome for any level of improvement, from a small typo to a new section, help us make the project better

All the source code is available at [github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/tree/master/docs)

## Committing to an all-contributors repo
We use the [angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) for commits which is used for an automated changelog generation, so it would be advisable to respect that.
If you're not used to it or are afraid to mis-type a commit, you can run `npm run commit` or `git cz` (if you have installed `commitizen`) which would take you through a few questions and write the commit for you.

## Editing Content

> **Pro Tip**: Every page has an _Edit_ button up the top, clicking this will take you straight to the GitHub source code for that page

Once on a file, click the 'pencil' icon to [easily edit the file inline](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)

## Translations
[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/all-contributors/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/all-contributors)

Our translations are managed through crowdin. You can help contribute by heading to [the crowdin project] and suggesting translations.
If you like, [comment on this issue](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/issues/143) to let us know you're helping or if you have any queries!

> When translating, its important that anything that has the [XPATH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) `@href`, `@src` etc should not be translated. Things like `code` should not be either. This will cause the project to 404. See below image for an example:
<img src="../../assets/translating-xpath.png" alt="Contribute to translating" />

> However, it's recommended to translate any content that would contribute to a better comprehension like the comments in `code` tags _as long as_ it doesn't change the actual code since it only understands English.

3. Click on any `*.md` files that aren't completely translated (read showing 100% on the right-hand side)
4. Write your translation in the _"Enter translation here"_ field (which would correspond to the translation of the text in the _"SOURCE STRING"_ field above) then click "SAVE"

> Call for translators! [We're looking for translators](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/issues/143) to help translate this spec for everyone!

## Help improve the all-contributors documentation!

Thanks for your interest in the project!
Pull Requests welcome for any level of improvement, from a small typo to new section, help us make the project better

All the source code is available at [github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/tree/master/docs)

## Editing Content

> **Pro Tip**: Every page has an _Edit_ button up the top, clicking this will take you straight to the GitHub source code for that page

Once on a file, click the 'pencil' icon to [easily edit the file inline](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)

## Translations
[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/all-contributors/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/all-contributors)

Our translations are managed through crowdin. You can help contribute by heading to [the crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/all-contributors) and suggesting translations.
If you like, [comment on this issue](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/issues/143) to let us know you're helping or if you have any queries!

> When translating its important that anything that has the XPATH `@href`, `@src` etc should not be translated. Things like `code` should not be either. This will cause the project to 404. See below image for an example:

# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the project! I definitely am interested in feedback and ideas on things for this
project around formatting, emoji used, etc. Feel free to file issues to discuss changes!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

## Project setup

You're going to need [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) to get the project, and [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies and run scripts.

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `yarn` in the repo directory to install dependencies
3. Create a branch for your PR

## Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the [all contributors][all-contributors] specification. To add yourself to the table of
contributors on the README.md, please use the automated script as part of your PR:

```console
yarn run add-contributor <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>
```

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a new type of contribution, you can run
it again and select the added contribution type.

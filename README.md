# All Contributors

This is a specification for recognizing contributors to a project in a way that rewards any and every contribution
whether or not it be code.

The basic idea is this:

> Use the project README (the most public part of most projects) to recognize the contributions of members of the project community.

People are giving of themselves and their free time to contribute to open source projects in so many ways. It can be a real
time sink sometimes and so they should be praised for all their contributions (code or not).

Use this project as an example implementation of the all-contributors specification (see the [Contributors](#contributors) section below).

## Specification

1. A section in a prominent place for the project (the `README.md` file for most projects) for a listing of contributors.
2. The listing is a table with the contributor's name, avatar (optional), a link of their choosing, and a listing of the different ways they've contributed (using the defined emoji).
3. The emoji is linked to relevant information (if reasonable).

ðŸ¤– A GitHub bot to automate acknowledging contributors to your open source projects.

## How the Bot Works

Implementing the [All Contributors spec](/specification) by hand is a laborious process.

The `@all-contributors bot` makes adding contributors for contributions of all kinds easy! 

1. First, you call the bot in any github issu or pull request and ask them to add a user for a specific contribution. 
2. Once you do this, the bot will automatically pull a user's profile image, grab the contribution type emoji, update the project README file with the new contributors and then open a Pull Request against the project.

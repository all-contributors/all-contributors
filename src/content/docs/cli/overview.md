## About the the All-Contributors Command Line Interface (CLI)

The all-contributors-cli is a tool that helps you automate adding contributor acknowledgements for your GitHub or GitLab repository at the command line. THe GitHub bot allows you to call our bot in a issue or pull request.

You want to use the command line because:
- You want to add contributors in bulk
- You want to add contributors as part of your project scripts
- You want to add contributors as part of your continuous integration (CI) process

Similar to the bot, the CLI allows you to implement the [All Contributors](../specification) spec, without maintaining the contributor table by hand.

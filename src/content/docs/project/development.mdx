Welcome to the development guide for the All Contributors documentation site!

## How to Work On Our Documentation

Our docs are built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme.
Astro is a javascript based static site generator.
It is is designed for building fast, modern websites with a focus on performance and flexibility.
It allows us to write components in multiple frameworks.
Astro ships only the minimal JavaScript needed.

We use the [Starlight theme with Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/).
Starlight provides a beautiful, accessible, and feature-rich documentation platform out of the box.
It handles navigation, search, dark mode, and supports [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## MDX Files

Our documentation pages are largely written using the  **MDX** (`.mdx`) format. This format supports Markdown with the additional ability to include components and custom elements directly in the content. This allows us to embed images, asides, and other interactive elements easily.

## Images paths and aliases

All images live in the assets directory.
We defined an alias to the assets directory in the site configuration file (`astro.config.mjs`) to make referencing items easier.

To see how this is defined, go to `astro.config.mjs`.
The alias for assets (@assets) is defined there:

```js
vite: {
    plugins: [tailwindcss()],
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@assets': '/src/assets',
      },
    },
```

## Adding Images to the Docs

We use the `<Picture>` utility to add images to our documentation. This utility supports a web compression feature that will automatically convert images to formats like webp and avif upon rendering.

To use the `Picture` utility:

1. First import the utility at the top of the `.mdx` file like this
  ```markdown
  import { Picture } from "astro:assets";
  ```
2. Optionally, define an alias for your image path at the top of the MDX file.
  You can also call it directly using a path.
  The image below has an alias of contributorsTableSmall and it's located in the assets directory of the site:
  ```markdown
  import contributorsTableSmall from '@assets/contributors-table-small.png';
  ```
3. Use the `Picture` utility in your MDX page like this
  ```markdown
  <Picture src={contributorsTableSmall} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="A screenshot of github showing a comment that says please add @user for docs." />
  ```

Notice that above we specify both avif and webp as formats.
This will allow the browser to choose the best format it supports.

## Styling Pages

Astro and Starlight support [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for styling.
You can add custom styles to individual pages using the `class` attribute on HTML elements.

In the config file code snippet above, you can see that Tailwind CSS is included as a Vite plugin. This allows us to use Tailwind's utility classes throughout our MDX files.

Tailwind is also a required dependency for Starlight, so it is already set up and ready to use.

We have also vendored a Google Font which is then applied in the global stylesheet.
The global stylesheet is located at `src/styles/global.css`. The configuration to add 
these styles globally is found in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

```js
 integrations: [
      starlight({
          customCss: [
              './src/styles/global.css',
              './src/fonts/font-face.css',
              ],
```

## Fonts

The all contributors documentation site uses the Google Font **Poppins** as a 
base font. For convenience and web page loading speed, we have vendored the font 
have vendored the font in the `assets/fonts` directory for quicker loading and 
rendering times. The font is applied globally to headers in the `global.css` file.

If we want to customize other font properties, we can do so in the `global.css` file.

Welcome to the development guide for the All Contributors documentation site!

## How to Work On Our Documentation

Our docs are built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and the Starlight theme. Astro is a javascript based static site generator. It is is designed for building fast, modern websites with a focus on performance and flexibility. It allows us to write components in multiple frameworks. Astro ships only the minimal JavaScript needed.

We use the [Starlight theme with Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/). Starlight provides a beautiful, accessible, and feature-rich documentation platform out of the box. It handles navigation, search, dark mode, and supports Tailwind CSS.

### MDX Files

Our documentation pages are largely written using the  **MDX** (`.mdx`) format. This format supports Markdown with the additional ability to include components and custom elements directly in the content. This allows us to embed images, asides, and other interactive elements easily.

### Adding Images to the Docs

We use the `<Picture>` utility to add images to our documentation. This utility supports a web compression feature that will automatically convert images to formats like webp and avif upon rendering.

To use the Picture utility:

1. First import the utility at the top of the `.mdx` file like thi:

`import { Picture } from "astro:assets";`

2. OPTIONAL: Define a path to the image that you want to render (optionally at the top of the MDX file) and assign it an alias name. You can also call it directly using a path. 

The image below has an alias of contributorsTableSmall and it's located in the assets directory of the site:

`import contributorsTableSmall from '@assets/contributors-table-small.png';`

Then add the Picture utility to your MDX page like this:

` <Picture src={contributorsTableSmall} formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="A screenshot of github showing a comment that says please add @user for docs." />`

Notice that above we specify both avif and webp as formats. This will allow the browser to choose the best format it supports.

## Custom paths for images

All images live in the assets directory for this site. We defined an alias to the assets folder in the site configuration file (`astro.config.mjs`) to the assets directory to make creating paths easier.  

To see how this is defined, go to `astro.config.mjs`. The alias for assets (@assets) is defined there: 

```js
vite: {
    plugins: [tailwindcss()],
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@assets': '/src/assets',
      },
    },
```

## Styling Pages

Astro and Starlight support Tailwind CSS for styling. You can add custom styles to individual pages using the `class` attribute on HTML elements.

In the config file code snippet above, you can see that Tailwind CSS is included as a Vite plugin. This allows us to use Tailwind's utility classes throughout our MDX files.

Tailwind is also a required dependency for Starlight, so it is already set up and ready to use.

## Fonts and Custom Branding

The all contributors documentation site uses the Google Font **Poppins** as a base font. For convenience and web page loading speed, we have vendored the font have vendored the font in the assets/fonts directory for quicker loading and rendering times.
